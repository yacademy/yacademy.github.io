# ZK Fellowship Program

<br>

**You may want to review our [pilot ZK auditing fellowship](/fellowships/zBlock1) to:** 
- (a) get a sense of what the fellowship is like and 
- (b) level up your understanding of ZK from an auditor perspective

<br>

<span class="fs-5"><span class="fw-700"><span class="text-blue-100">Commitment:</span></span></span> 

The time commitment is **>=20 hours per week**.

<br>
<span class="fs-5"><span class="fw-700"><span class="text-blue-100">Duration:</span></span></span> 


<b>The fellowship is 1-3 months and includes theory sessions, code overview sessions, and retreat sessions with leading experts in the field. </b>

Developments in ZK proving systems informs our choice of what theory and implementations we choose in our upcoming ZK auditing fellowships. Tentatively, our next fellowship will be in late Q3 2023.

<br>

Other than the [general](/fellowships) requirements, no prior ZK knowledge is required.

- The auditing sprint starts on Monday with an overview session delivered by one of our resident auditors, a guest auditor, or the codebase author.
- During the week, async discussion take place between fellows, mentors, guest auditors, residents, and codebase devs.
- Fellows can work in groups during the week. Groups may meet during the week over calls.
- At the end of the sprint, fellows present their findings and receive feedback from our residents, mentors, and codebase authors.
- The auditing sprint ends with a retreat session where we invite a prominent guest for a lecture or AMA with the fellows.
