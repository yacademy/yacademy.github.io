- The auditing sprint starts on Monday with an overview session delivered by one of our resident auditors, a guest auditor, or the codebase author. 
- During the week, async discussion take place between fellows, mentors, guest auditors, residents, and codebase devs. 
- Fellows work in groups during the week. Groups may meet during the week over calls.
- At the end of the week (or second week for larger codebases), fellows present their findings and receive feedback from our residents, mentors, and codebase authors.
- The auditing sprint ends with a retreat session where we invite a prominent guest for a lecture or AMA with the fellows.
