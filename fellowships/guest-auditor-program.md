# Guest Auditor Program

<br>
Auditing is a lonely business, but it doesn't have to be that way. 

If you have a track record in the security space (audits, bounties, or security research), we welcome you to be our guest for 1-2 weeks.

You will be prepped and supported by our resident auditors and core staff. All you have to do is show up and engage with our residents and fellows for the duration of 1 auditing sprint (typically 1-2 weeks).

You will be given access to the codebase well in advance to familiarize yourself with it. Our auditing sprints are a mix of sync calls and async discussions. Our fellows work in groups, and you'll have access to their groups to participate and mentor, alongside our resident auditors who are always there as well.

**If you think you are a good fit for the program (yay!), please [contact us](mailto:hello@yacademy.dev?subject:guest-auditor-program).**
